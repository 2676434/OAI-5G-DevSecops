#service type is fixed to clusterIP, it is only support for non multus interface (eth0)


# These helm-charts can be used for two purpose
# 1. RFSimulated oai-gNB: Only requires 1 interface for N2 and N3. You can use Kubernetes default interface eth0
# 2. Physical gNB with Ethernet based USRP or RRU: You need to use ruInterface to connect with RU. Make sure that the ip-address you choose can reach to RU. 
#                                                 Using a dedicated interface for N2 or N3 is optional you can still use eth0. 

## NOTE: To use these charts with USRP B210 you need to modify and mount usb from the host.
